# Weather at Charlotte/Douglas International Airport 
## Info 

So, I have been running out of data ideas for the time being so I decided that I would do a weather project. Also, I kind of figure that every person who wants to be a data scientist should have a weather data project. 
The data in this file was gathered from the fivethirtyeight blog at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/us-weather-history/KCLT.csv. 

# Getting started
## Installing 

You will need to have the pandas and matplotlib libraries installed. This program also uses Python 3.4 but any Python 3.X should work.
